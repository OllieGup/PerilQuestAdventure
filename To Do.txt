1. Add the Flask code to my PQ script to use the app.routes
2. create HTML templates (index.html and game.html) to display the game content 
and forms for user input

you should primarily work in the Flask Python file (app.py) and use JavaScript in the HTML file (game.html)
to interact with the user and display the results.

Look at the texts in index and into files as some are the same or too similar
